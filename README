About
-----
- petrobots.cpp is the main game logic ported line by line from the 6502 files PETROBOTS.ASM and BACKGROUND_TASKS.ASM
- Platform.h is essentially an interface with platform specific implementation classes
- Various #defines starting with PLATFORM_ can be used to build a variant with different features using the same platform implementation
- To port to a new platform, create a new PlatformXYZ.cpp/h implementation based on the existing ones and instantiate it in main() (petrobots.cpp)
- If the target platform version will only support a certain feature set, feel free to get rid of the unnecessary PLATFORM_ #ifdefs manually or using a preprocessor
