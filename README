Attack of the PETSCII Robots C++
================================
Ported by Vesa Halttunen <vesuri@jormas.com>
Work in progress

About
-----
- petrobots.cpp is the main game logic ported line by line from the 6502 files PETROBOTS.ASM and BACKGROUND_TASKS.ASM
- Platform.h is essentially an interface with platform specific implementation classes
- Various #defines starting with PLATFORM_ can be used to build a variant with different features using the same platform implementation
- To port to a new platform, create a new PlatformXYZ.cpp/h implementation based on the existing ones and instantiate it in main() (petrobots.cpp)

SDL version
-----------
brew install sdl2 sdl2_image

Amiga TODO
----------
Code
- Fit as many assets to memory as possible
- Build PET look version
- Use all four channels for sound effects if not playing music

Graphics
- Fix mismatched tiles
- Workbench icon (Vesa can provide)
- Death animation frames (not needed if current implementation is fine)
- Fix evilbot graphics (not needed if current implementation is fine)

Audio
- Pistol sound (currently FreeDoom, licensing unclear)
- Explosion sound (currently FreeDoom, licensing unclear)
- Try to improve highest notes
- Check if the fourth channel can be used less
